MEDICAL CASE STUDY: CHEST PAIN EVALUATION

Patient Presentation:
A 55-year-old male presents to the emergency department with acute onset chest pain that began 2 hours ago while at rest. The pain is described as a crushing, substernal pressure that radiates to the left arm and jaw. The patient rates the pain as 8/10 in severity.

Vital Signs:
- Blood Pressure: 160/95 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 95 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 22/min
- Temperature: 98.6Â°F
- Oxygen Saturation: 96% on room air

Past Medical History:
- Hypertension (diagnosed 5 years ago)
- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (diagnosed 3 years ago)
- Hyperlipidemia
- Family history of coronary artery disease (father had MI at age 60)

Current Medications:
- Metformin 1000mg twice daily
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Atorvastatin 20mg daily

Physical Examination:
- General: Anxious appearing male in moderate distress
- Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
- Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Extremities: No edema, pulses intact
- Neurological: Alert and oriented x3

Initial Laboratory Results:
- Troponin I: 0.8 ng/mL (elevated, normal <0.04)
- CK-MB: 25 U/L (elevated, normal <5)
- Total Cholesterol: 220 mg/dL
- LDL: 140 mg/dL
- HDL: 35 mg/dL
- Triglycerides: 180 mg/dL
- HbA1c: 8.2%

ECG Findings:
- Sinus rhythm at 95 bpm
- ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF (inferior leads)
- ST depression in leads I and aVL
- Q waves beginning to form in leads III and aVF

Diagnosis:
Acute ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) - Inferior wall

Management Plan:
1. Immediate reperfusion therapy with primary PCI
2. Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel)
3. Anticoagulation with heparin
4. Beta-blocker therapy (metoprolol)
5. ACE inhibitor therapy
6. Statin therapy
7. Blood glucose management
8. Pain control with morphine

Key Learning Points:
- ST elevation in inferior leads (II, III, aVF) indicates inferior wall MI
- Reciprocal ST depression in lateral leads (I, aVL) supports the diagnosis
- Elevated cardiac enzymes confirm myocardial necrosis
- Time is muscle - early reperfusion is critical
- Risk factors include diabetes, hypertension, and family history
- Dual antiplatelet therapy reduces risk of stent thrombosis
- Beta-blockers reduce myocardial oxygen demand
- ACE inhibitors improve long-term outcomes post-MI

Complications to Monitor:
- Arrhythmias (especially bradycardia with inferior MI)
- Heart failure
- Cardiogenic shock
- Recurrent ischemia
- Bleeding complications from antithrombotic therapy

Follow-up Care:
- Cardiology consultation
- Echocardiogram to assess wall motion abnormalities
- Cardiac rehabilitation program
- Aggressive risk factor modification
- Regular follow-up with cardiologist
